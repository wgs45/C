## Introduction

C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language that is widely used in system and application software, embedded systems, and more. This repository contains various projects and code examples to help you learn and improve your C programming skills.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects in this repository:

1. **Basic Programs**
   - Hello World
   - Data Types and Variables
   - Control Structures (if, switch, loops)
   - Functions

2. **Intermediate Programs**
   - Pointers and Memory Management
   - Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
   - Algorithms (Sorting, Searching)

3. **Advanced Projects**
   - File I/O Operations
   - Dynamic Memory Allocation
   - Networking and Sockets

## Setup and Installation

To run the C programs in this repository, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. We recommend using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any modern IDE like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion.

### Installation Steps

1. **GCC on Linux/Mac:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install gcc
   ```

2. **GCC on Windows:**
   - Download and install MinGW from [MinGW official site](http://www.mingw.org/).
   - Add `C:\MinGW\bin` to your system PATH.

3. **Using an IDE:**
   - Download and install your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion).
   - Follow the IDE-specific setup instructions.

## Usage

To compile and run a C program, navigate to the directory containing the `.c` file and use the following commands:

```sh
gcc filename.c -o outputfile
./outputfile
```

For example:

```sh
gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world
./hello_world
```
