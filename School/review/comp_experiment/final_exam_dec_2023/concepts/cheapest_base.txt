```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
```
These are standard C library headers. `stdio.h` is for input and output operations, and `limits.h` is for integral type size limits.

```c
int main() {
    int use_case = 0, r = 0;
```
The `main` function begins. It declares two integer variables `use_case` and `r` to store the number of test cases and a loop counter, respectively.

```c
    scanf("%d", &use_case);
```
This line reads the number of test cases (`use_case`) from the standard input.

```c
    for (r = 0; r < use_case; r++) {
        printf("Case %d: \n", r + 1);
```
A `for` loop is initiated to iterate over each test case. It prints the case number.

```c
        int base_cost[36] = {0};
        int query_time = 0, query_num = 0, i;
```
Inside the loop, an array `base_cost` is declared to store the cost of each base (up to base 36), and two integers `query_time` and `query_num` are declared to store the number of queries and the current query number, respectively.

```c
        for(i = 0; i <= 35; i++) {
            scanf("%d", base_cost + i);
        }
```
A `for` loop reads the cost of each base from the input and stores it in the `base_cost` array.

```c
        scanf("%d", &query_time);
```
This line reads the number of queries (`query_time`) for the current test case.

```c
        int time = 0;
```
An integer variable `time` is declared to iterate over the queries.

```c
        for (time = 0; time < query_time; time++) {
            int sum[37] = {0};
```
Another loop is initiated to process each query. An array `sum` is declared to store the sum of costs for each base (up to base 36).

```c
            scanf("%d", &query_num);
```
This line reads the current query number (`query_num`) from the input.

```c
            int min = INT_MAX;
            int j = 0;
```
Two variables are declared: `min` to store the minimum sum of costs and `j` as a loop counter.

```c
            for (j = 2; j <= 36; j++) {
                int temp = query_num;
                do {
                    sum[j] += base_cost[temp % j];
                    temp = temp / j;
                } while (temp > 0);
                if (min > sum[j]) {
                    min = sum[j];
                }
            }
```
A loop is initiated to calculate the sum of costs for each base. It uses a nested loop and a do-while loop to repeatedly divide the query number by the base and accumulate the costs. The minimum sum is also updated during this process.

```c
            printf("Cheapest base(s) for number %d: ", query_num);
```
Prints a message indicating the current query number.

```c
            int k = 0, len = 0;
            char str[1000] = {'\0'};
```
Declares integer variables `k` and `len`, and a character array `str` to store the bases with the minimum sum.

```c
            for (k = 0; k <= 36; k++) {
                if (sum[k] == min) {
                    if (len == 0) {
                        len += snprintf(str + len, sizeof(str) - len, "%d", k);
                    } else {
                        len += snprintf(&str[len], sizeof(str) - len, " %d", k);
                    }
                }
            }
```
A loop is initiated to find bases with the minimum sum. It uses the `snprintf` function to format and append the base numbers to the `str` array.

```c
            printf("%s\n", str);
        }
```
Prints the bases with the minimum sum for the current query.

```c
        if (r != use_case - 1) {
            printf("\n");
        }
```
Prints a newline between test cases, except for the last one.

```c
    }
```
Ends the loop for test cases.

```c
    return 0;
}
```
Indicates successful program execution.
