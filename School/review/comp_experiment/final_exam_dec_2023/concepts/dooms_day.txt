```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```
These are standard C library headers. `stdio.h` is for input and output operations, and `stdlib.h` is for functions involving memory allocation and other general utilities.

```c
// c program to calculate doomsday date
```
This is a comment indicating the purpose of the program.

```c
int main() {
```
This is the starting point of the program. The `main` function is the entry point for C programs.

```c
  const int day_in_a_month[] = {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
  const char *day_in_a_week[] = {"Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday"};
```
Two arrays are declared and initialized:
- `day_in_a_month`: It represents the number of days in each month, with an extra element at the beginning (0) for indexing purposes.
- `day_in_a_week`: It represents the days of the week, starting from Friday.

```c
  int use_case, month, day, i, total_days;
```
Variables are declared to store the input values and other intermediate values. `use_case` represents the number of test cases, `month` and `day` represent the month and day for each test case, `i` is a loop counter, and `total_days` will store the total number of days from the beginning of the year.

```c
  // input use_case
  scanf("%d", &use_case);
```
Reads the number of test cases from the standard input.

```c
  while(use_case--) {
```
A `while` loop is initiated, which will iterate `use_case` times. The loop will execute the block of code inside for each iteration.

```c
    scanf("%d %d", &month, &day);
```
Reads the month and day for the current test case from the standard input.

```c
    total_days = 0;
```
Initializes `total_days` to 0 for each test case.

```c
    for (i = 0; i < month; i++) {
      total_days += day_in_a_month[i];
    }
```
A `for` loop is used to calculate the total number of days from the beginning of the year up to the specified month. It adds the days in each month to `total_days`.

```c
    total_days += day;
```
Adds the days in the current month to `total_days`.

```c
    printf("%s\n", day_in_a_week[total_days % 7]);
```
Prints the day of the week corresponding to the total number of days using the `% 7` operation to ensure it cycles through the days of the week.

```c
  }

  return 0;
}
```
The program returns 0, indicating successful execution. This is the end of the `main` function.
